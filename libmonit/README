libmonit


This library synthesis modules used by Monit into a static library. This
factoring of functionality into a separate library represent the first step in
our process of refactoring and improving Monit.

What you see here now is only a small subset of the actual library and just the
bare minimum for what is necessary to implement 'check program'.

The long-term goal is to reduce the source code of Monit to basically a
parser for the configuration language and a validator which will run the
different checks. The rest of the code will be moved into libmonit.
